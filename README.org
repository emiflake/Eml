#+TITLE: Eml
#+DESCRIPTION: The Eml programming language

* Introduction
** What is Eml?
   A very evil language that barely works;
   but more generally a lambda calculus 
   with Hindley-Milner type system that 
   compiles to JavaScript.
** What isn't Eml?
   Anything useful, move on.

* What's here
  You can view some examples in the [[https://github.com/emiflake/Eml/tree/master/examples][examples]] folder.

main = \_. (log "Hello, world")
#+END_SRC
